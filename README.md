# Bootcamp infrastructure setup
## Requirements

First, create the VPC by using https://github.com/sknop/bootcamp-vpc.
The output of the terraform script serves as the input into these Ansible scripts.

## Hashicorp Vault for certificate generation

Hashicorp Vault is used to generate the CA (certificate authority) for the entire bootcamp
and to generate the certificates for Samba, the Confluent services and for the applications.

## Samba as domain controller for Kerberos and LDAP

Edit the file inventory. You need to adjust the IP address of your samba host:

`vault ansible_host=54.78.227.71`

And the location of the SSL key generated by the above terraform script.

`ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/Users/Sven/IdeaProjects/bootcamp-vpc/bootcamp.pem`

Once done run command:

ansible-playbook playbook.yml

This will install the infrastructure required to create a fully secured Confluent cluster
via https://github.com/sknop/bootcamp-terraform and cp-ansible.

# What is installed

* Vault 
* Samba
* Root CA
* Intermediate CA
* truststore
* Webservice that will serve both service and client certificates and Kerberos keytabs
